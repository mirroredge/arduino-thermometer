# Arduino Thermometer
Arduino based food thermometer. It uses an Arduino Uno, Ada Fruit LCD shield (https://www.adafruit.com/products/772), Thermocouple and amplifier (https://www.adafruit.com/products/270, https://www.adafruit.com/products/269), and a Piezo.  The LCD shield is the user interface allowing selections of a specific meat type or range. When the selected type of meat is cooked to the desired temperature then the LCD screen will become red and the Piezo will buzz.
